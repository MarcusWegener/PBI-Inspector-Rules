# PBI-Inspector Rules Repository

This repository contains PBI-Inspector rule templates created by me. These templates are designed to be used with the community project [PBI-Inspector](https://github.com/NatVanG/PBI-Inspector) by Nat Van Gulck.

## About the Rule Files

The rule files in this repository have been created to the best of my knowledge and judgment. They can serve as templates for creating your own rules. However, I cannot guarantee that these rule files cover all possible scenarios or remain functional after updates to Power BI.

## Disclaimer

- The rules provided are intended as a starting point and may require customization to suit specific use cases.
- Compatibility with future versions of Power BI is not guaranteed.
